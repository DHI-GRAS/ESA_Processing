WOIS_Processing
===============

WOIS version of the QGIS Processing plugin. 

The major difference with QGIS Processing plugin are some additional scripts and models created as part of the Water Observation Information System (WOIS) developed under the TIGER-NET project funded by the European Space Agency as part of the long-term TIGER initiative aiming at promoting the use of Earth Observation (EO) for improved Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) in Africa.
